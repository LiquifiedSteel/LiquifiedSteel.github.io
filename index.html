                            <p>DarkHorse IT is a web app we built to run our public site. The front end is a multi page app that handles navigation, layout, and responsive design so it feels quick on phones and desktops. The contact form talks to a simple backend that checks reCAPTCHA on the server and then delivers messages to us. We use a reviews widget for Google feedback and added logic so it reinitializes when you move around the app without needing a full refresh. Content and settings live in environment variables so we can ship the same build to different environments without code changes. The goal was a clean, reliable site that is easy to maintain and extend over time.</p>

It is a remake of the site they already had, intended to be more readable and easier to use for the users. It also fixes the main issue our client was concerned with, and that is the fact that whenever an application was made, the WFPS admins got an email that they then had to put into their Excel spreadsheet. We made it so admins can take all of the current applications and export them as an Excel file.</p>

I completed it over the course of a 2 week sprint. The site has full CRUD as well as working payments processing through Stripe. As of now it is incomplete and will be deployed once it is finished. There are just a few finishing details I will need to get to before deployment becomes realistic.</p>
